# FFXI-HorizonXI-Maps
Some of the missing HD maps which I've taken time to edit myself.  These are based both on AkadenTK's Remapster Maps and Moop FFXI HD Hunting Maps for cleaner and more informative maps.

The map for Western Aletpa Desert is a modified version of Moops's map with the numbering re-edited to match those seen on the wiki maps.  I've also done a very minor fix to the Yhoator Jungle map where an accessible tunnel was missing and also to the Yuhtunga Jungle map where branches leading back into Ifrit's Cauldron were incorrect and missing the location for the Cerment Headstone.

Currently I've only done a few 2048x2048 maps.  To use these create a new folder in Game/polplugins/DATS using whatever name you fancy and move the folders into that directory (minus the 2048x2048 folder.)  You might need to edit the pivot.ini file found in HorizonXI/Game/config/pivot manually to place it near the top of the list like so:

	[overlays]
	0=horizonmusic
	1=xiview
	2=horizonoverrides
	3=gg101-maps
	4=moop-remapster-labeled
	5=remapster
	6=horizonhd
