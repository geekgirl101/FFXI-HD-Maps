# FFXI-HorizonXI-Maps
Some of the missing HD maps which I've taken time to edit myself.  These are based both on AkadenTK's Remapster Maps and Moop FFXI HD Hunting Maps for cleaner and more informative maps.

The map for Western Aletpa Desert is a modified version of Moops's map with the numbering re-edited to match those seen on the wiki maps.

Currently I've only done the 2048x2048 maps.  To use these create a new folder in Pivot using whatever name you fancy and move the folders into that directory (minus the 2048x2048 folder.)  Enxure that these override any other maps you have enabled in Pivot by typing /pivot and checking that they appear just under horizonoverrides.
