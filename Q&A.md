__Do I need to download both the Hunting Maps and the Clean Maps?__

No.  These are divided into 2 types of maps to suit your preference.

____
__I don't like the Hunting Maps, how do I switch to Clean Maps?__

Simply download the Clean Maps and delete the folder you downloaded the Hunting Maps in and create a new folder and drop your Clean Maps in there.

____
__I don't see any changes in the game!__

You'll need to fully log out and back in again for the maps to take effect.
If you're replacing files that are already there the change won't require a restart, but you'll have to reload Minimap if you're using that addon 
as it won't update otherwise.

____
__Can I overwrite the official files instead of using Pivot?__

Yes you can, but this is inadvisable in case of any files that may be corrupted during the download process.  Also if you decide you don't want to 
use these files later on you won't be able to just simply remove them and would have to redownload the entire FFXI game again.

____
__I don't like your maps, can I go back to the old ones?__

Yes, you can do this in the game by clicking on the - next to the folder name you created for my maps and then restart the game.  This will return 
your maps back to the previous ones.
