__Q. Do I need to download both the Hunting Maps and the Clean Maps?__

__A.__ No.  These are divided into 2 types of maps to suit your preference.  Using both at the same time will have one pack overwrite the other.

____
__Q. I don't like the Hunting Maps, how do I switch to Clean Maps?__

__A.__ Delete the folder you downloaded the Hunting Maps in, create a new folder for the Clean Maps then download and drop the Clean Maps in there.

____
__Q. I don't see any changes in the game!__

__A.__ You'll need to fully log out and back in again for the maps to take effect.
If you're replacing files that are already there the change won't require a restart, but you'll have to reload Minimap if you're using that addon 
as it won't update otherwise.

____
__Q. Can I overwrite the official files instead of using Pivot?__

__A.__ Yes you can, but this is inadvisable in case of any files that may be corrupted during the download process.  Also if you decide you don't 
want to use these files later on you won't be able to just simply remove them and would have to redownload the entire FFXI game again.

____
__Q. I don't like your maps, can I go back to the old ones?__

__A.___ Yes, you can do this in the game by clicking on the - next to the folder name you created for my maps in Pivot and then restart the game.
